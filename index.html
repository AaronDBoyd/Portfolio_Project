  <h1>Aaron Boyd's Web Delopment Portfolio</h1>
  <h2>Aaron Boyd is my name and coding is my game!</h2>
  <p>Hello! my name is Aaron and I am an aspiring web developer. I am from Las Vegas, Nevada. My hobbies and interests include: </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Playing Music</li>
    <li>Running</li>
    <li>Dogs and general Puppery</li>
    <li>Video Games</li>
    <li>Cooking</li>
    <li>Drawing/Painting</li>
    <li>Reading</li>
  </ul>
  <p>I became interested in coding when I realized how much opportunity and potential there is this industry. Seeing it how most everything in our world today is based in computers, to some degree, it makes sense for me to be involed in the ever-growing field of technology.</p>
  <p>Most of my work experience has been in the restaurant industry. Through bartendening and serving I've learned how to communicate with people in order to give them the best possible experience. I feel that this skill will translate well by helping me establish relationships and realize the needs of potential employers and clients.</p>
